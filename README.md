Capstone Project for Colt Steel's Web Developer Bootcamp

Utilizes Node, Express, and Bootstrap for front end css (no front-end framework for this repo). This project helped me learn so much about web development, authentication, Restful Routing, Backend Development, and more. Taking this course and completing this project inspired me to get into web development.  

# To Run
(Assuming you have Node) Navigate to home directiory and run "node app.js" from the command line.
