# YelpCamp
Capstone Project for Colt Steel's Web Developer Bootcamp

Utilizes Node, Express, MongoDB and Bootstrap for front end css (no front-end framework for this repo). This project helped me learn so much about web development, authentication, Restful Routing, Backend Development, and more. Taking this course and completing this project inspired me to get into web development.  

# To Run
* (Assuming you have Node) Navigate to home directiory and run "node app.js" from the command line. 
* Note, database is in my locally installed version of MongoDB, so running the app might not lead to much content for another user. Perhaps I will add data to a free Mongo cloud db.
